# harness — Setup Wizard

> **How to use this:** Open Claude Code in your project directory. Paste this file (`WIZARD.md`) into the conversation. Claude follows the wizard below — asks one question at a time, waits for your answer, and only proceeds when you confirm.

> **Brand new to Claude Code?** Read [`kit/07-onboarding-quickstart.md`](kit/07-onboarding-quickstart.md) for a 5-minute primer first. Come back here when you're ready to set up.

> **Want the architecture context first?** [`README.md`](README.md) is the project tour; [`kit/00-MASTER-GUIDE.md`](kit/00-MASTER-GUIDE.md) is the architecture deep-dive; [`kit/08-self-correction.md`](kit/08-self-correction.md) explains the defense-in-depth layers. The wizard below is the setup entry point.

## For Claude (read first, do not skip)

You are running an interactive setup wizard for a colleague who may be new to Claude Code. Follow these rules strictly:

1. **One question at a time.** Wait for the user's answer before asking the next one.
2. **Show progress.** After every step, reprint the checklist below with `[x]` for done, `[~]` for skipped, `[ ]` for pending.
3. **Skipping is always valid.** If the user says "skip", "later", or "not now" for any step, mark it `[~]` and move on. Do not lecture about why a step matters.
4. **Stop on demand.** If the user says "stop", "pause", or "exit", checkpoint the current state into a comment and exit gracefully. The user can resume later.
5. **Respect prerequisites.** Never run a step whose prerequisites are unsatisfied. Tell the user what's missing and offer to backfill it (or skip both).
6. **Confirm destructive actions.** Always show a diff or planned-action summary before creating files outside the project root, overwriting existing files, or running `chmod`.
7. **Keep questions short.** One sentence. Use `(option1 / option2 / skip)` format. Avoid open-ended prose questions unless the step explicitly needs prose (e.g., "describe your tech stack").
8. **Reference the kit AND the templates.** When the user picks a module, read the relevant kit file (`kit/0X-*.md`) for context and customization guidance. Then **copy from `templates/` as the canonical source for files**:
   - Personas → copy from `templates/personas/<name>.md` into `.claude/commands/<name>.md`
   - Hook scripts → copy from `templates/scripts/<name>.sh` into `.claude/hooks/<name>.sh`
   - Helper scripts (`skill_context.sh`) → copy into `.claude/scripts/`
   - Vault note templates → copy from `templates/vault/*.md` into the user's `<Vault>/templates/`
   - Substitute placeholders (`{{IMPLEMENTER_NAME}}`, `{{VAULT_NAME}}`, `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}`, etc.) based on user input. Leave persona-flavor placeholders (`{{PERSONA_DESCRIPTION}}`, `{{EXPERTISE_*}}`) as TODO markers if the user picks `generic only` in Q4.3.
9. **No project-specific assumptions.** This kit is generic. Mirror the user's own project terminology back to them.

When ready, greet the user with:
> "Welcome. This wizard sets up Claude Code on your project. Estimated time 5–40 min depending on modules picked. Reply `start` to begin, or `tell me more` for an overview first."

---

## Wizard Checklist

The wizard walks through three layers: orientation → module selection → per-module setup. Every step is independently skippable.

### Step 0 — Orientation

- [ ] **Q0.1** Is this your first time using Claude Code? (yes / no / skip)
  - If yes → recommend reading [`kit/07-onboarding-quickstart.md`](kit/07-onboarding-quickstart.md) before proceeding
- [ ] **Q0.2** Project directory absolute path? (paste path / `cwd` / skip)
- [ ] **Q0.3** Brief project description — tech stack, domain, main goals in 1–2 sentences
- [ ] **Q0.4** Vault folder name and absolute path. **Required even if you skip Module A** — Module B's `settings.local.json` references it. If you skip Module A, the `additionalDirectories` and vault permission lines are omitted entirely (Claude treats the field as unused, not as a broken pointer). (default name: `MyProjectVault`, default path: sibling of project dir / no vault)

---

### Step 1 — Pick Your Modules

- [ ] **Q1.1** Which modules do you want today? Pick any combination of letters:

| Letter | Module | Time | Why |
|--------|--------|------|-----|
| **A** | Vault | 10 min | Obsidian knowledge base outside the repo |
| **B** | Claude config | 10 min | CLAUDE.md + settings.local.json (recommended starting point) |
| **C** | Personas | 20 min | Slash commands like `/implementer`, `/reviewer`, `/orchestrator` |
| **D** | Hooks | 10 min | Session/commit/edit automation |
| **E** | Validation | 5 min | Smoke test |

  - Reply with letters (e.g., `B C D`) or shortcuts: `all` (everything), `minimum-modules` (B only), `starter` (B + C), `everything` (A B C D E)

> Note: the words `minimum`, `productive`, `extended`, `full` appear later as **persona-tier** names in Q4.1 and **hook-tier** names in Q5.1. They mean different things in each step. The module shortcuts above intentionally avoid those words to prevent collision.

> Claude: only run the steps below for modules the user picked. Mark unselected modules `[~]` (skipped) up front.

---

### Step 2 — Module B: Claude Config

> Prerequisites: none. Recommended baseline.

- [ ] **Q2.1** Tell me about your tech stack — languages, frameworks, build system, key directories
- [ ] **Q2.2** Generate `CLAUDE.md` from [`kit/01-claude-md-template.md`](kit/01-claude-md-template.md), filling tech stack. **Leave `{{*_SKILL}}` placeholders in the routing table for Module C to fill.** (yes / skip)
- [ ] **Q2.3** Generate `.claude/settings.local.json` from [`kit/06-settings-reference.md`](kit/06-settings-reference.md) Section 6 (full assembled file). Strip the `hooks:` block (Module D inserts it). Substitute placeholders: `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}`, `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` from Q2.1; `{{VAULT_ABSOLUTE_PATH}}` and `{{VAULT_NAME}}` from Q0.4. **If Module A is skipped, omit the Section-4 vault-permission lines and the `additionalDirectories` field entirely** — do not leave them pointing at a non-existent path. **If Module C is skipped or `pragmatist`/`investigator` are not picked, omit `Skill(...)` lines for those personas.** Verify the resulting file parses as valid JSON before writing. (yes / skip)
- [ ] **Q2.4** Copy [`kit/05-token-strategy.md`](kit/05-token-strategy.md) content (strip frontmatter) to `.claude/token_strategy.md`? (yes / skip)
- [ ] **Q2.5** Create `.claude/` directory tree (`skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `scripts/`, `sessions/`)? (yes / skip)

---

### Step 3 — Module A: Vault

> Prerequisites: Obsidian app installed. If you skipped Module B, settings.local.json edits in this step are inert until you run Module B later.

#### What the vault is (read first)

The vault is a separate Obsidian folder that lives **outside your code repo**. It is the durable knowledge layer that survives across branches, sessions, and conversations.

- **What it stores:** decisions (ADRs), bug post-mortems, implementation plans, daily session logs, guides, workflows, weekly summaries, long-lived reference notes.
- **What it is not:** It is not project source code. It is not documentation that belongs in the repo's README. It is not a chat scratchpad.
- **Why a separate repo:** Knowledge outlives feature branches. Vault commit cadence is different from code. Multiple projects can later share one vault. No risk of accidentally committing vault notes to the code repo.

**How Claude Code uses it:**

- **Reads from it** at session start (hooks inject active plans, recent dailies, recommended guides into the prompt) and on demand (the `/vault` and `/investigator` skills search it).
- **Writes to it** automatically — `on_commit.sh` appends commit entries to today's daily note; `on_agent_stop.sh` appends agent findings; the `/weekly` command generates rollup summaries.
- **Skills consult it** before producing answers — when a bug recurs, the second-session investigator finds the prior post-mortem; when you start a feature, the planner finds the active plan.

**Default size assumption:** light to medium. A solo engineer accumulates ~5–50 notes per active feature. The vault scales by feature, not by codebase.

**Skip Module A if:** You do not want persistent knowledge tracking. The rest of the kit still works — only the `/vault` command, the `/weekly` command, and vault-writing hooks become inert.

> **Want a deeper tour before setting up?** Read [`kit/04-vault-blueprint.md`](kit/04-vault-blueprint.md) section *Vault — What It Is and Why* first.

- [ ] **Q3.0** Did you read the "What the vault is" block above and want to proceed? (yes / tell me more / skip Module A)
- [ ] **Q3.1** Confirm vault path from Q0.4 (or override now). Default: `../MyProjectVault`.
- [ ] **Q3.2** Is Obsidian CLI on PATH? Run `which obsidian` and report. If not found, also check `ls /Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/Obsidian 2>/dev/null` (macOS bundle path). The binary ships with the desktop app but is not on PATH by default — offer `ln -s /Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/Obsidian /usr/local/bin/obsidian` as the symlink step. (found on PATH / found in app bundle / not installed / skip)
  - If genuinely not installed → offer the install steps from [`kit/04-vault-blueprint.md`](kit/04-vault-blueprint.md)
- [ ] **Q3.3** Create vault folder structure. Recommended approach: `bash templates/scripts/init_vault.sh ../<vault-name>`. This creates `analysis/`, `bugs/`, `daily/`, `decisions/`, `guides/`, `memory/`, `plans/{active,planning,legacy/{completed,superseded}}/`, `reference/`, `templates/`, `weekly/`, `workflows/`, copies all 9 vault note templates from `templates/vault/`, and initialises a git repo. (yes — use script / yes — manual / skip)
- [ ] **Q3.4** *(skip if Q3.3 used the script — already done.)* Initialize the vault as its own git repo? (yes / skip)
- [ ] **Q3.5** Symlink `vault -> ../<vault>` in project root? (yes / skip)
- [ ] **Q3.6** Verify `additionalDirectories` entry in `settings.local.json` points at the actual vault path (Q2.3 already pre-filled from Q0.4 — confirm it's correct). (yes / fix it / skip — only valid if Module B ran)

---

### Step 4 — Module C: Personas

> Prerequisites: Module B (CLAUDE.md must exist so the routing table can reference personas).

- [ ] **Q4.1** Which starter personas? Pick a tier (templates live in `templates/personas/`):
  - `minimum` — exactly these 3: implementer, reviewer, investigator
  - `productive` — exactly these 5: minimum + mentor + pragmatist
  - `extended` — exactly these 7: productive + orchestrator + vault + weekly
  - `full` — all 12: implementer, investigator, reviewer, safety, performance, crash, mentor, pragmatist, orchestrator, vault, weekly, domain-skill
  - `custom` — list specific names from `templates/personas/` ([`kit/02-skill-catalog.md`](kit/02-skill-catalog.md) explains the pattern)

  > **For Claude:** before generating any persona files, **echo back the exact list** you will install based on the user's tier choice and ask "confirm? (yes / change)". Do NOT add personas the user did not pick — including "useful extras" like mentor. The tier is a contract, not a starting point. If the user wants a non-default set, they say `custom`.
- [ ] **Q4.2** For each chosen persona, pick delivery format. Default rule: skills with sub-files go to `.claude/skills/NAME/SKILL.md`; single-file personas go to `.claude/commands/NAME.md`. **Five personas (implementer, investigator, reviewer, safety, performance) use the forked-context pattern: `context: fork` + matching `.claude/agents/NAME.md` file** — see [`kit/02-skill-catalog.md` § The Forked-Context Pattern](kit/02-skill-catalog.md). (auto / let me decide each / skip)
- [ ] **Q4.3** Customize each persona's domain language to match your project? (yes / generic only / skip)
  - **`yes`** = ask the user for project terminology, fill `{{PERSONA_DESCRIPTION}}`, `{{EXPERTISE_*}}`, `{{SAFETY_AREA_*}}` placeholders with real content
  - **`generic only`** = leave placeholders as literal `{{PERSONA_DESCRIPTION}}` markers. Persona files load and respond, but with empty flavour text where the markers sit. User can fill them later by editing the skill files directly. Validation Q6.4 should explicitly check that no `{{...}}` markers leak into responses.
- [ ] **Q4.4** Replace `{{*_SKILL}}` placeholders in CLAUDE.md routing table with the persona names you picked. (yes / skip)
- [ ] **Q4.5** Create `.claude/agents/<name>.md` subagent metadata for the forked-context skills (default: implementer, investigator, reviewer, safety, performance). Required for the orchestrator to spawn them via Task. (yes — required for orchestrator / skip if not using orchestrator)

---

### Step 5 — Module D: Hooks

> Prerequisites: Module B (settings.local.json must exist). Module A recommended — vault-writing hooks are inert without a vault but do not error.

- [ ] **Q5.1** Pick starter hook set (copy from `templates/scripts/` into `.claude/hooks/`):
  - `minimum` — `session_context.sh` + `track_modified.sh` + `on_commit.sh` + `session_cleanup.sh`
  - `productive` — minimum + `lint_on_edit.sh` + `pre_compact.sh`
  - `full` — productive + `enforce_task_tests.sh` + `on_agent_stop.sh` + `lint_precommit.sh` + project-specific hooks
- [ ] **Q5.2** Copy `templates/scripts/_common.sh` to `.claude/hooks/_common.sh`. (yes — required for any hook)
- [ ] **Q5.3** Copy `templates/scripts/skill_context.sh` to `.claude/scripts/skill_context.sh` — referenced by every persona's `## Context` block. (yes — required)
- [ ] **Q5.4** Substitute `{{VAULT_NAME}}` in `_common.sh` and `skill_context.sh` with the vault name from Q0.4. (yes — required)
- [ ] **Q5.5** Make all hook + helper scripts executable (`chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh .claude/scripts/*.sh`). (yes — required)
- [ ] **Q5.6** Insert `hooks:` block into existing `settings.local.json` with correct event matchers (SessionStart, PostToolUse Edit|Write, PostToolUse mcp__git__git_commit, SessionEnd, plus `Stop` and `SubagentStop` for `full` tier). **For `SubagentStop`: substitute the matcher with the actual persona handles the user picked in Q4.** If the user kept generic names, use `implementer|reviewer|investigator|safety|performance`. If they renamed (e.g., to `/o7`, `/devil`, `/hanji`), use `o7|devil|hanji|gojo|rock`. The hook only fires when the matcher matches the agent name. See `kit/06-settings-reference.md` § hooks for the full layout. (yes — required)

---

### Step 6 — Module E: Validation

> Run only the questions for modules you completed.

- [ ] **Q6.1** *(after B)* Start a session: `claude` from project root — completes without errors? (yes / error)
- [ ] **Q6.2** *(after B + D)* SessionStart context banner appears with branch + recent dailies? (yes / no)
- [ ] **Q6.3** *(after A)* `obsidian daily:read vault=<your-vault-name>` prints today's note (or empty result, not error)? (yes / no)
- [ ] **Q6.4** *(after C)* `/<your-implementer-name> hello world` loads the persona and responds? Replace `<your-implementer-name>` with the actual command name (default: `/implementer`). **Also check: does the response contain any literal `{{...}}` markers?** If yes, the persona file has unsubstituted placeholders — re-run Q4.3 with `yes` to fill them. (yes — clean / yes — but placeholders leaked / no — persona missing)

---

### Step 7 — Wrap-up

- [ ] **Q7.1** Save the completed checklist as a vault note in `daily/` for future reference? (yes / no)
- [ ] **Q7.2** Want first-week customization suggestions? (yes / not now)
  - Customize `on_commit.sh` `auto_tag()` for your directory layout
  - Add 1 project-specific skill from a recurring pattern you've noticed
  - Write your first vault guide in `vault/guides/<tech>/`
- [ ] **Q7.3** Anything unclear or broken? (describe / no — done)

---

## Self-Correction Architecture (short version)

This kit assumes LLM-driven engineering fails in predictable ways: over-confident first-pass code, hidden assumptions, runaway token bills, agents re-doing each other's work, "I forgot what we decided last week." It stacks correction at every layer those failures can be caught.

**Five layers, compounding:**

| Layer | What catches it | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **1. Skill** | Intra-skill discipline | persistent-memory check, mentor's Iron Rules, structured handoff protocol, `context: fork` for expensive skills |
| **2. Multi-agent** | Cross-skill cross-check | orchestrator tier system (L1/L2/L3) with mandatory justification, Reasoning Budget Used feedback loop, adversarial reviewer in parallel with safety + pragmatist |
| **3. Token economy** | Cost discipline | direct-tools-first rule, per-agent budget caps, tests-run-once at end |
| **4. Hooks** | Gate enforcement | `enforce_task_tests.sh` blocks completion, `lint_precommit.sh` blocks commits, `track_modified.sh` + `on_commit.sh` audit trail, `pre_compact.sh` state snapshot |
| **5. Vault** | Long-term memory & pattern catch | `bugs/` post-mortems, ADRs in `decisions/`, `/weekly` drift synthesis, `guides/` crystallization once a pattern recurs |

No single layer is load-bearing. A bug that slips Layer 1 should hit Layer 2; a token explosion that slips Layer 3 still surfaces in Layer 5's weekly review.

**Full doc:** [`kit/08-self-correction.md`](kit/08-self-correction.md) — covers every layer with concrete examples, a worked end-to-end task showing all layers firing, and the failure modes this architecture explicitly does not catch.

## Alternative: auto-detect script

For a non-interactive setup, `setup_ai_workspace.sh` scans the project and generates everything in one command:

```bash
./setup_ai_workspace.sh --project-dir . --vault-dir ../MyProjectVault --ide claude
```

The script is the fast path. The wizard above is the flexible path. Pick whichever fits.
